# Availity_Test

## Question 1: Tell me about your proudest professional achievement.  It can be a personal or school project.  

My first major accomploshment was using a TDD testing approach to plan out, and then further on build a fullstack app using react, redux, monggoDB and other various tools. This app was built for the healthcare sector, tracking clients weight and health goals, and delivering a clients information abput their overall physical and financial health goals

The 2nd accomplishment was building out a large Sql database with Node.js for a home health agency in southern california. This app was used to help nurses monitor and keep track of their patients and their relationship with them. Keeping track of doctor orders, medications, payment informatiomn and making sure everything was heavily protected and valid uder HIPAA and other regulations was a constant struggle, but I learned a great deal durinmg the process. I beleive the experiece made me a much better programmer.

## Tell me a about a book, blog, article or GitHub repo you read or liked recently, and why you like it and why you should recommend I do the same. 

I read a lot of various blog posts and medium artciels aboiut various concepts revolving around javascript, react, HTML/CSS, data structures and algorithms, etc etc so it's hard to reccomment just one. There is however a book I return more often than not. Eloquent Javascript, is one of the best books out there to understand pure vanilla javascripts. Once you have a strong foundation in JS, espeically in it's approach to objects and classes, that frameworks such as react and vue become much easier to understand. 

I am also currently reading Gayle Laakmann McDowell "How to crack the Coding interview"

## 3. If you were to describe to a 7-year old what Availity does, what would you say?

I would tell a child that Availity works as sort of bridge, helping doctors and nurses connect with different healthcare insurance companies.

##  You are tasked to write a checker that validates the parentheses of a LISP code.  Write a program (in Java or JavaScript) which takes in a string as an input and returns true if all the parentheses in the string are properly closed and nested.
